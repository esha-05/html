                    <p><b>Web development is the process of building websites and apps for the internet—or for a private
                            network known as an intranet.
                            Web developers bring the design and functionality of a website to life,
                            writing code that determines things like style, layout, and interactivity.
                            From the most simple, static web pages to social media platforms and apps;
                            from e-commerce websites to content management systems (like WordPress)—all the tools we use
                            via the internet have been built by web developers.</b> </p>
                    <p><b>There are three different types (or layers) of web development: The frontend, the backend, and
                            database technology. Frontend development, otherwise known as client-side scripting,
                            encompasses all the elements of a website that the user experiences directly.
                            Things like layout, font, colors, menus, and contact forms are all powered by the
                            frontend.</b></p>
                    <p><b>Backend development, or server-side scripting, is all about what goes on behind the scenes.
                            When you interact with a website in some way—for example, filling out a form and clicking
                            “submit”—the frontend communicates this action to the backend. The backend responds by
                            sending the relevant information to the frontend—for example,
                            the code needed to display a message such as “Thank you for filling out this form”.The
                            frontend, backend, and database technology all work together to build and run a fully
                            functional website or application. As such, these three layers form the foundation of web
                            development. </b> </p>
